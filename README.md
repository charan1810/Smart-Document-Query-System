Smart Document Query System is an RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) based LLM (Large Language Model) model which is very helpful for enhancing information retrieval and answering complex queries directly from a wide range of documents. By combining the strengths of retrieval systems with generative AI, this system allows users to query vast amounts of unstructured data, such as PDFs, reports, and other documents, and retrieve highly relevant and accurate answers. It simplifies document analysis, enabling faster access to critical information, improving productivity, and ensuring better decision-making by providing concise and contextually rich responses based on specific document content.
